<div>
  Some companies have naming conventions, this often results in long names which take to much space when displayed. This setting lets you define a global regular expression to define what part of the full name should be shown in the graphs. Default is <code>.*</code>, which shows the full name.<br />
  <code>com.comp.proj.(.*)</code> will strip 'com.comp.proj' from every project name.<br />
  With the group definition one can define the group of the given regex to be used.
